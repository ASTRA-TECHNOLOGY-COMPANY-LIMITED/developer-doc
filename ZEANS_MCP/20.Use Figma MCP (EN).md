> ⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**
>
> -   Keep your access token secure and never share it publicly
> -   If you suspect your token has been compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a new one
> -   Store your token in environment variables or secure configuration files, never in your code directly

## II. MCP Settings

3. Execute this command in your terminal or development environment
4. Verify the connection is successful

Your Figma MCP server is now ready to use with your applications! You can start using Figma's API capabilities through the MCP server integration for enhanced workflow automation and design system management.

## III. Code Generation

After setting up the MCP integration, you can start generating code from your Figma components. Here's how to do it:

### 1. Copy Figma Component URL

![Copy Component Link](./images/18.copy%20component%20link.png)

1. Open your Figma design file
2. Right-click on the component you want to generate code for
3. Select "Copy/Paste" from the context menu
4. Choose "Copy link" to get the component's URL
5. The copied URL will look something like: `https://www.figma.com/file/[FILE_ID]/[FILE_NAME]?type=design&node-id=[NODE_ID]&mode=design`

### 2. Write Generation Prompt

To generate code from your Figma component, you'll need to write a prompt that includes:

1. The component URL you copied
2. Specific requirements for the code generation, such as:
    - Target framework (React, Vue, etc.)
    - Styling approach (CSS, Tailwind, etc.)
    - Responsive design requirements
    - Accessibility requirements
    - Any specific functionality needs

Example prompt format:

```
Please generate [framework] code for this Figma component: [COMPONENT_URL]
I need it to:
- Use [styling approach]
- Be responsive for [screen sizes]
- Include [specific features/requirements]
- Follow [accessibility standards]
```

> 💡 **Tips for Better Results:**
>
> -   Be specific about your technical requirements
> -   Mention any dependencies or constraints
> -   Specify if you need any particular features or behaviors
> -   Include any accessibility requirements
> -   Mention if you need documentation or comments in the generated code
