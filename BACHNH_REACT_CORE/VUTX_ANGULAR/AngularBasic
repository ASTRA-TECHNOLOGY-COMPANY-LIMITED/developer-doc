# Angular Overview

# What is Angular?

- Angular is open-source front-end web framework developed by Google.
- It's designed to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

# Key Features

## 1. Structured Framework:

Angular provides a well-defined structure that helps in organizing code efficiently. Its modular approach with components, services, and modules makes code more maintainable and scalable.

## 2. Powerful Templating and Data Binding:

Angular’s two-way data binding simplifies the synchronization between the model and the view, reducing the need for manual DOM manipulation.

## 3. Dependency Injection:

Built-in dependency injection simplifies component management, making the codebase more modular, reusable, and testable.

## 4. TypeScript:

Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds strong typing, improved tooling, and better error detection to JavaScript development.

## 5. Rich Ecosystem and Community Support:

Angular has a vast ecosystem with tools like Angular CLI for project scaffolding, Angular Material for UI components, and NgRx for state management. The community actively contributes libraries, extensions, and resources.

## 6. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture:

Angular follows the MVVM architecture, making it easier to separate concerns, manage application logic, and enhance testability.

## 7. Cross-Platform Development:

With Angular, developers can use the same codebase to build applications for the web, mobile (using frameworks like NativeScript or Ionic), and desktop (using Electron).

## 8. Comprehensive Tooling:

Angular offers a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for testing, debugging, and performance optimization, aiding in faster development cycles.

## 9. Robust Routing and Navigation:

Angular’s router provides powerful features for handling navigation and routing between different views or pages within an application.

## 10. Backed by Google:

Angular is maintained and backed by Google, which ensures continuous updates, improvements, and long-term support.

# Getting Started

To begin with Angular, you need to install Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Then, follow these steps:

- Create a new Angular project: `ng new --no-standalone project-name`
- Run the development server: `ng serve`

## 1. src Folder:

app Folder:

- components Folder: Contains Angular components, each with its HTML, TypeScript, and CSS/SCSS files.
- services Folder: Contains services responsible for handling data, making API calls, and sharing information between components.
- models Folder: Houses data models/interfaces used to define the structure of objects within the application.
- assets Folder: Stores static files like images, fonts, and global stylesheets.
- environments Folder: Holds environment-specific configuration files for development and production environments.
- app.module.ts: The root module of the application where you define dependencies and bootstrap the app.
- app-routing.module.ts: File responsible for managing routing and navigation within the application.
- app.component.ts: The root component that hosts the main application logic and templates.

## 2. e2e Folder (End-to-End Testing):

- Contains files and configurations for end-to-end testing using tools like Protractor.

## 3. node_modules Folder:

- Stores all the project's dependencies installed via npm or yarn.

## 4. Configuration Files:

- angular.json: Configuration file for Angular CLI settings, build configurations, and project-specific settings.
- package.json and package-lock.json or yarn.lock: Files defining project metadata, dependencies, and scripts for npm or yarn.
- tsconfig.json: Configuration file for TypeScript compiler settings.

## 5. README.md File:

- A markdown file containing essential information about the project, its setup, usage, and any other relevant details for developers.
