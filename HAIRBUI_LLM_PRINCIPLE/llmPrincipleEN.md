# Working Principles of LLMS

Large language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human-like text. This is a detailed explanation of how they work:

## Step 1: Input Processing

### Tokenization

- **Purpose**: Convert text into manageable pieces. This helps the model handle diverse vocabulary efficiently.
- **Process**:
		- Split sentences into tokens, which can be words or subwords.
		- Use techniques like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to handle unknown words by breaking them into known subword units.

### Embedding

- **Purpose**: Transform tokens into numerical vectors that the model can process.
- **Process**:
		- Each token is mapped to a high-dimensional vector.
		- These vectors capture semantic relationships between words.

## Step 2: Model Architecture

### Transformer Layers

#### Self-Attention

- Calculates attention scores to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
- Allows the model to weigh the importance of each token relative to others.
- Uses queries, keys, and values to compute weighted representations.

#### Feedforward Networks

- Applies non-linear transformations to the attention outputs.
- Consists of linear layers and activation functions like ReLU.

#### Layer Normalization

- Stabilizes and speeds up training by normalizing outputs within each layer.

## Step 3: Training

### Pre-Training

- **Objective**: Learn general language understanding
- **Tasks**:
		- Language Modeling: Predict the next word in a sequence
		- Masked Language Modeling: Predict missing words in a sentence.
- **Data**: Train on vast corpora from books, articles, websites, etc.

### Fine-Tuning

- **Objective**: Adapt the model to specific tasks.
- **Process**: Use smaller datasets focused on tasks like sentiment analysis or translation.
- **Benefits**: Improves performance on domain-specific applications.

## Step 4: Inference

### Contextual Understanding

- The model uses learned patterns to interpret input and predict outputs.
- Maintains context over long texts, enabling coherent responses.

### Token-by-Token Generation

- Predicts the next token based on current context.
- Continues until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., end of sentence).

## Step 5: Output

### Decoding

- Converts predicted token vectors back into words or phrases.
- Uses techniques like beam search or sampling to refine output quality.

### Post-Processing

- Cleans and formats the text for coherence and readability.
- May involve grammar correction and punctuation adjustments.
